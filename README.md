# CPSC349
Spring 2025
Creating the CPSC 349 Final Project began with building a standard HTML structure, including the <style>, <head>, and foundational elements for a basic website. I started by giving my site a title, then styled it using colors I liked and added design elements such as smooth scrolling, transition effects, and padding for visual balance.

For the navigation bar, I created a class that links to different sections of the site and ensures consistent labeling across each page section. One of the biggest challenges I faced was inserting my profile picture on the Home section. The original image was too large, so I opted to link it via an external URL instead of uploading it directly. Once that was resolved, formatting the image and writing a short introductory message was straightforward.

Next, I developed the About section, which contains a full paragraph explaining who I am, my major, and additional details so that visitors can get to know me better. I also included a downloadable resume by linking it to my Google Docs, since I wasnâ€™t sure how else to make it accessible for download.

Below the About section, I showcased my past projects. For each one, I described the challenges I encountered and the skills I gained. I also included links to Google Docs where viewers can see project images or read more in-depth descriptions.

In the Skills section, I created a clear side-by-side list of my technical and non-technical skills for easy viewing. Finally, I added a Contact Me form where users can enter their name, email, and a message to reach out to me directly.
